## Introduction

This is a Power BI project I created based on an online course. The project utilizes Power BI to analyze survey data covering various aspects such as salaries, programming languages, and other personal survey questions. The visualizations provide insightful perspectives on key aspects of the industry, including participants' countries, average salary by job title, job satisfaction regarding work-life balance, popular programming languages, and the level of difficulty in entering the data field.
